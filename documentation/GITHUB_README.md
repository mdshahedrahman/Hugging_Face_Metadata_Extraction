# HuggingGraph: Understanding the Supply Chain of the LLM Ecosystem

HuggingGraph is a directed, heterogeneous graph of supply-chain relationships
among Hugging Face models, datasets, Spaces, libraries, licenses, tasks, agent
frameworks, and linked GitHub repositories. Version 1 captures model derivation, dataset-to-model
training references, and dataset derivation. Version 2 extends that graph with
model and dataset relationships to libraries, licenses, tasks, and GitHub
repositories. Version 3 adds Space relationships to models, datasets, GitHub
repositories, licenses, tasks, and agent frameworks. The current v3 artifact
reflects the October 2, 2026 analysis snapshot.

This repository contains artifacts related to the CIKM 2025 paper:

> *HuggingGraph: Understanding the Supply Chain of the LLM Ecosystem*

## Released artifacts

| File | Status | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `HuggingGraph_v0.dot` | Legacy | Original paper-era graph using raw repository IDs and the `label` edge attribute. |
| `HuggingGraph_v1.dot` | Previous | Expanded graph with typed model/dataset IDs and both `label` and `edge_type` attributes. |
| `HuggingGraph_v2.dot` | Previous | Version 2 graph with model and dataset attribute relationships. |
| `HuggingGraph_v3.dot` | Current | October 2, 2026 Version 3 graph with expanded Dataset relationships and six Space relationship families. |
| `subgraph.pdf` | Example | Small visualization suitable for inspection. |

Version 0 remains available for reproducibility. Version 1 is a schema update,
not a byte-compatible replacement for v0. Version 2 preserves every v1 edge
and adds eight model/dataset attribute subgraphs. Version 3 preserves those
relationship families, refreshes their normalized inputs, expands the
Dataset-to-Dataset candidate graph, and adds Space nodes. The v0, v1, and v2
files remain unchanged for reproducibility.

## HuggingGraph v3 source pipeline

The authoritative October 2, 2026 graph-construction code is in the
[`source/`](source/) directory. The release uses 17 selected Python scripts
plus [`source/requirements.txt`](source/requirements.txt). Install its direct
Python dependencies with:

```bash
python -m pip install -r source/requirements.txt
```

Python 3.10 or later is recommended.

### Shared preparation, validation, and assembly

- [`count_model_types.py`](source/count_model_types.py) classifies model
  derivation evidence used by the model-lineage builder.
- [`model_dataset_attribute_edges.py`](source/model_dataset_attribute_edges.py)
  provides shared model and Dataset attribute normalization.
- [`audit_dataset_subgraphs.py`](source/audit_dataset_subgraphs.py) audits the
  Dataset relationship families and reports coverage and consistency checks.
- [`prepare_hugginggraph_v3_edges.py`](source/prepare_hugginggraph_v3_edges.py)
  normalizes and count-checks the 17 numbered edge inputs.
- [`build_hugginggraph_v3.py`](source/build_hugginggraph_v3.py) validates the
  final edge and node totals and constructs `HuggingGraph_v3.dot`.

The 17 scripts named above are the curated v3 source set. Large metadata
snapshots, final CSV/JSONL edge projections, and intermediate analysis outputs
are intentionally not committed to `source/`.

## HuggingGraph v3 scale

HuggingGraph v3 contains 17 logical relationship families. This refreshed v3
is based on the October 2, 2026 analysis. It includes the extended
Dataset-to-Dataset candidate union, refreshed Dataset attributes, Space
relationships, and one normalized GitHub repository identity across model,
Dataset, and Space sources.

| Relationship | Unique edges | Unique nodes within subgraph |
|---|---:|---:|
| Model to model | 966,035 | 978,868 |
| Dataset to model | 362,064 | 287,539 |
| Dataset to dataset | 12,541 | 15,172 |
| Model to library | 1,311,386 | 1,214,466 |
| Dataset to library | 16,864 | 16,467 |
| Model to license | 1,090,845 | 1,092,560 |
| Dataset to license | 331,317 | 332,328 |
| Model to task | 577,077 | 541,491 |
| Dataset to task | 317,412 | 211,454 |
| Model to GitHub repository | 962,855 | 729,920 |
| Dataset to GitHub repository | 188,888 | 196,768 |
| Model to Space | 941,121 | 487,287 |
| Dataset to Space | 83,061 | 85,762 |
| Space to GitHub repository | 113,755 | 90,895 |
| Space to license | 420,369 | 420,557 |
| Space to task | 43,223 | 42,229 |
| Space to agent framework | 37,059 | 37,016 |
| **Unified HuggingGraph v3** | **7,775,872** | **See the node-type breakdown below** |

The node total is the global union of all endpoints. Relationship-specific
node counts must not be added because the same node can occur in several
subgraphs.

| Node type | Unique nodes in v3 |
|---|---:|
| Model | 1,888,591 |
| Dataset | 431,324 |
| Space | 712,728 |
| Library | 2,148 |
| License | 4,888 |
| Task | 839 |
| GitHub repository | 96,678 |
| Agent framework | 11 |
| **Total** | **3,137,207** |

The Dataset-to-Dataset value is an extended candidate union rather than the
5,217-edge conservative metadata-only baseline. Its 12,541 unique Dataset
pairs combine the official metadata baseline with high-confidence README
lineage evidence and externally revalidated Dataset references. Because the
aggregate DOT stores one edge per unique pair, these edges use
`dataset_relationship_candidate`; evidence-specific relationship types remain
available in the analysis outputs used to construct the release.

The verified Space population contains 1,481,220 repositories: 413,102 have
at least one model or dataset relationship and 1,068,118 do not. Three Space
IDs present in the card snapshot were unavailable during relationship
reconciliation and are excluded from that verified population. Among connected
Space nodes, 59,747 link to 31,148 normalized GitHub repositories through
113,755 unique Space-to-GitHub edges.

## Crawled populations

| Population outcome | Models | Datasets |
|---|---:|---:|
| Readable README/card | 1,975,515 | 698,202 |
| No readable README | 1,005,324 | 286,579 |
| Restricted repository | 48,538 | 38,353 |
| **Total processed** | **3,029,377** | **1,023,134** |

## Node identifiers

Versions 1 through 3 prefix Hugging Face and categorical node IDs with their
entity type. Version 3 uses seven typed prefixes plus canonical GitHub repository URLs:

```text
model::owner/repository
dataset::owner/repository
space::owner/repository
library::library-name
license::license-identifier
task::task-identifier
agent::framework-name
https://github.com/owner/repository
```

Typed IDs prevent a model repository and a dataset repository with the same
`owner/repository` string from collapsing into one graph node. To recover the
underlying identifier, split once on `::` and use the second component.
GitHub repository nodes are instead stored as normalized HTTPS repository URLs
so that they can be followed directly.

## Edge schema

Lineage edges are directed from an upstream artifact to a downstream artifact.
Attribute edges are directed from a model, dataset, or Space to the relevant
artifact or category node.

| Canonical `edge_type` | Source | Target | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `finetune` | model | model | Target is fine-tuned from source. |
| `adapter` | model | model | Target is an adapter derived from source. |
| `quantized` | model | model | Target is a quantized form of source. |
| `merged` | model | model | Target is a merge containing source. |
| `trained_on` | dataset | model | Source dataset is declared as training data for target model. |
| `derived_from` | dataset | dataset | Target dataset is derived from source dataset. |
| `dataset_relationship_candidate` | dataset | dataset | Candidate Dataset relationship from the October 2 expanded union. |
| `uses_library` | model or dataset | library | Source declares or is associated with the target library. |
| `has_license` | model, dataset, or Space | license | Source declares or is associated with the target license. |
| `performs_task` | model | task | Model performs or is associated with the target task. |
| `supports_task` | dataset or Space | task | Source supports or is associated with the target task. |
| `links_to_github` | model, dataset, or Space | GitHub repository | Source metadata contains a link to the target repository. |
| `used_by_space` | model or dataset | Space | A Space declares use of the source artifact. |
| `uses_agent_framework` | Space | agent framework | A Space declares or is classified with the target framework. |

Each v1, v2, and v3 DOT edge carries two relationship attributes:

```dot
"model::parent" -> "model::child"
    [label="finetune", edge_type="finetune"];
```

`edge_type` is the canonical attribute. `label` is supplied for software
written for v0. For merge edges only, the values intentionally differ:

```dot
[label="merge", edge_type="merged"]
```

This preserves the v0 term while making `merged` the canonical v1 term.

## Migration and compatibility

Consumers moving from v0 to v1 should:

1. Prefer `edge_type`; fall back to `label` for legacy files.
2. Treat legacy `merge` and canonical `merged` as aliases.
3. Recognize the additional `converted`, `new_version`, and `derived_from`
   relationships.
4. Preserve `model::` and `dataset::` while operating on graph nodes.
5. Remove the type prefix before using an identifier with the Hugging Face API.
6. Account for the fact that v1 contains connected endpoints rather than
   standalone population nodes.

Consumers moving from v1 to v2 should additionally:

1. Recognize `library::`, `license::`, and `task::` node IDs, plus normalized
   `https://github.com/owner/repository` targets.
2. Recognize `uses_library`, `has_license`, `performs_task`, `supports_task`,
   and `links_to_github` edge types.
3. Keep model tasks and dataset tasks semantically distinct.
4. Treat library-tag, task-tag, and embedded GitHub references as weaker than
   explicit declarations.
5. Use a streaming DOT parser or a filtered subgraph when loading the complete
   DOT graph would exceed available memory.

Consumers moving from v2 to v3 should additionally:

1. Recognize `space::` and `agent::` node IDs.
2. Recognize `used_by_space` and `uses_agent_framework` edge types.
3. Permit Space sources for `links_to_github`, `has_license`, and
   `supports_task` relationships.
4. Treat the 59,747 GitHub-linked Spaces as a subset of the 712,728 connected
   Space nodes rather than an additional node population.

## Loading DOT with NetworkX

Python 3.10 or later is recommended.

```bash
pip install networkx pydot
```

```python
from itertools import islice

from networkx.drawing.nx_pydot import read_dot


def unquote(value):
    return str(value).strip('"')


def relationship(attributes):
    value = attributes.get("edge_type") or attributes.get("label") or ""
    value = unquote(value)
    return "merged" if value == "merge" else value


def typed_identifier(node):
    node = unquote(node)
    if "::" not in node:
        return "unknown", node  # v0 raw identifier
    return tuple(node.split("::", 1))


graph = read_dot("HuggingGraph_v3.dot")

print(f"Nodes: {graph.number_of_nodes():,}")
print(f"Edges: {graph.number_of_edges():,}")

for source, target, attributes in islice(graph.edges(data=True), 10):
    source_type, source_id = typed_identifier(source)
    target_type, target_id = typed_identifier(target)
    edge_type = relationship(attributes)
    print(source_type, source_id, edge_type, target_type, target_id)
```

NetworkX and pydot may require substantial memory for the complete v3 graph.
For large-scale analysis, prefer streaming the DOT file or extracting a smaller
subgraph before loading it into an in-memory graph library.

## Visualization

Graphviz can render a small extracted subgraph:

```bash
dot -Tsvg subgraph.dot -o subgraph.svg
dot -Tpdf subgraph.dot -o subgraph.pdf
```

Rendering the complete v3 graph directly to SVG, PDF, or PNG is generally
impractical because of its size. Use a filtered subgraph for visualization.

## Paper context

HuggingGraph supports forward and backward tracing of dependencies, helping
researchers, auditors, and policymakers investigate provenance and inherited
security, bias, and licensing risks.
